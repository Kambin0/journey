# journey

This project is a full stack web application that uses angular for the front end, Spring Boot with JAva for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

I created this web application to demonstrate and apply my knowledge to a project that I am passionate about. I love to get out and see the world and capture the beauty of it with my camera. This website showcases some of my photography from various locations. Using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, I was able to create a visually appealing front end for the website. The backend holds some statistics from locations I have visited.
